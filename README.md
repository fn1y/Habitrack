# Habitrack

A habit tracking application built in Swift, SwiftUI, using SwiftData to store habits.

This is a school project, my very first application. Beware of messy fixes and general silliness. I plan to continue working on it after my deadline as a personal thing. It's a very rewarding pastime!


## Features

- Habit storage, retrieval, and management with SwiftData
- Beautiful visualisations of your progress to keep you motivated
- Customisable notification reminders
- Built entirely in SwiftUI with Apple Design sensibilities in mind
